Setup
=====

Prepare 4x SSA toothbrush boards and assemble them into a toothbrush block.

Preparing a SSA chip for mounting:
1) SSA chips come coated with photoresist. Must be cleaned by alternating between acetone and alcohol, ending with alcohol.

Mounting the SSA chip onto the toothbrush board:
1) Glue with Hysol EA 9309.3 a 0.25" x 0.25" x 0.005" niobium square on the toothbrush board pad where the SSA will be placed. Let cure for 1 hour at 50 deg C.
2) Glue with Hysol EA 9309.3 the SSA chip onto the niobium square. Let cure for 1 hour at 50 deg C.
3) Wirebond SSA according to diagram.
4) [optional] Make gold wirebonds for thermal sinking using the provided pads.

Mount four toothbrush boards into toothbrush module:
1) ...

Note that series array chips that are put into toothbrush boards are not intended to be removeable and should be treated as permanently attached!


PSquid DiffAmp input
--------------------

PSquid Gain = GDAC + 1
PSquid Input Range = -2.048 V -> 2.048 V

Dip probe box can be driven with any DAC. The S3B/FB DACs are a little funky since they have the built-in connections. Instead just use S2/S1 DACs to drive dip probe inputs.

PSquid  ->  Dip Probe
------      ---------
S2B     ->  BIAS
S2FB    ->  OFFSET
S1B     ->  IN
S1FB    ->  FB
